Whats new in 2.6.0 (22.2.2023)

- removed src/CMakeLists.txt and put its contents inside toplevel CMakeLists
- improved arguments and argument parsing
    - added [-x|--exit <bool>] argument which is true if you want to exit the program
      after use
    - using external args library to parse args (https://github.com/Taywee/args)
    - args don't need to be ordered now, and you can pass any that you like
- figured that todo.txt is kinda unnecessary
- Replaced the data/variables.txt with a MPCS.ini file
    - added external library for using .ini (https://github.com/mcmtroffaes/inipp)
- Improved Picture.hpp/.cpp to be leaner and better documented

Whats new in 2.5 (22.2.2023)

- this version is a hotfix for the issue that had been occurring for the past week with
  coordinates not being generated properly due to non functional links on the site
  (contacted MPC, they fixed it), and MPCS not following redirects (also fixed)
- also removed the "allowed_links.txt" file since its existence isnt really necessary
  (links are now hardcoded)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
